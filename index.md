Hi! My name is Rudy. I code in Node.js, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Java, and C++. Frameworks and tools that I have worked on: React.js, React Native, Vue.js, Flask, Spring, Ruby on Rails, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, and some machine learning libraries.

I like american football üèà, basketball üèÄ and ultimate frisbee üíø.


## My Projects
* [YouSurv](https://github.com/nerdijoe/YouSurv), A survey web application built in React and Spring Boot.
* [PhishLens](https://github.com/nerdijoe/Phish-Lens), A chrome extension with machine learning to detect phishing sites and notify user in real time. 
* [Kayak Search Engine](https://github.com/nerdijoe/kayak), A travel search engine for finding and booking flights, hotels, and rental cars. 
* [React Storage](https://github.com/nerdijoe/spring_dropbox), A personal cloud storage service. 
* [IKU](https://github.com/nerdijoe/foodmon-go), Android mobile app built in React Native for food exploration. Think of Pok√©mon GO, instead of monsters popping out, restaurants will pop out within certain radius while user is moving.
